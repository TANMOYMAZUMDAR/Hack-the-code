# THE BINARY DISINTEGRATION 

You are given a positive integer X and you want to get the number 1 from it.

We know that X is not equal to 1, Therefore,you need to repeat the following actions on the given number : if X is odd , then you need to add 1 to X, else you need to divide X by 2.

How many actions you need to perform so that you get 1 from X.

## Input Format :

First line contains t number of test cases.
Next t line contains an integer X in Binary Representation .

## Constraints :
```
1<=X<=10^6
```
# Output Format :
